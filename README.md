You’re going to build a company homepage for a real or imagined company. You’ll get to decide exactly what content to include for this company, but you should at least include:
    A title and logo or splash image.
    A mission statement or brief description of the company.
    A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.
    A section describing some of the company’s employees or teammates.

Your project should use flexbox styling for layout. Aim to use flexbox’s advantages, such as easy horizontal and vertical positioning, flexible element flows as the page size changes, and great styling for repeated elements.

Our example site uses:
    A simple color scheme using CSS named colors, but yours can be more elaborate with hexadecimal, RGB, or HSL colors.
    Fonts from the Google Fonts API.
    Custom images. A great source for project images when you’re practicing web design is Unsplash.

Description:

"Nestled within the heart of the picturesque Ozark region, 'Ozark Botanica' beckons with its rustic charm and earthy allure. More than just a shop, it's a sanctuary where nature, artistry, and community converge in perfect harmony.

Step inside, and you'll find a treasure trove of locally crafted goods, each item bearing the mark of skilled artisans from our vibrant region. Handmade ceramics, textiles, jewelry, and more line the shelves, reflecting the essence of the Ozarks' creative spirit.

But 'Ozark Botanica' is more than just a boutique; it's a place of shared knowledge and inspiration. Our community gathers here, drawn by the call of cross quarters, solstices, and equinoxes, to celebrate the rhythms of nature and the magic of each season. As a metaphysical and witchcraft shop, we offer a range of mystical tools and knowledge to empower our visitors on their spiritual journeys.

We hold dear our commitment to sustainability, embracing eco-conscious practices that honor the Earth's resources. Our garden oasis outside provides a tranquil retreat, and the art gallery within showcases the talent of local artists, ever-changing and ever-inspiring.

We are proud to be a safe space for the LGBTQIA+ BIPOC community, where everyone is celebrated and embraced as they are.
