You’re going to build a company homepage for a real or imagined company. You’ll get to decide exactly what content to include for this company, but you should at least include:
    A title and logo or splash image.
    A mission statement or brief description of the company.
    A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.
    A section describing some of the company’s employees or teammates.

Your project should use flexbox styling for layout. Aim to use flexbox’s advantages, such as easy horizontal and vertical positioning, flexible element flows as the page size changes, and great styling for repeated elements.

Our example site uses:
    A simple color scheme using CSS named colors, but yours can be more elaborate with hexadecimal, RGB, or HSL colors.
    Fonts from the Google Fonts API.
    Custom images. A great source for project images when you’re practicing web design is Unsplash.
